This is a recursion lab with two parts.  The first part is worth 20 points, and
the second is worth 80.

<H2>Part 1: Enumerating Strings</h2>

Your first job is write a program called <b>enum</b>, which is called as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
enum length ones
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This program should enumerate all strings of length <b>length</b> that contain
<b>ones</b> ones, and (<b>length</b>-<b>ones</b>) zeros, and print them on 
standard output in sorted order.  For example:
<pre>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 2 2</b></font>
11
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 2 1</b></font>
01
10
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 2 0</b></font>
00
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 3 1</b></font>
001
010
100
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 3 2</b></font>
011
101
110
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 5 3</b></font>
00111
01011
01101
01110
10011
10101
10110
11001
11010
11100
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 100 100</b></font>
1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>enum 100 0</b></font>
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>
</pre>
You may puzzle about how to do this, but it is easy with recursion.  
What I did was define a class called <b>Enum</b>, which has two public methods:
<UL>
<LI> A constructor that takes the length of the string
<LI> A recursive function called <b>do_enumeration</b> that takes an index and a number-of-ones.
</UL>
It also has two protected pieces of data:
<UL>
<LI> A string, which is initialized to have the proper length.
<LI> The length.
</UL>
My <b>main()</b> processes the command line arguments, and then allocated an instance of
<b>Enum</b> with the given length.  It then calls the <b>do_enumeration()</b> method with
an index of zero and number-of-ones equal to the command line argument.
<p>
<b>do_enumeration()</b> is recursive.  The base case is when index is equal to length.
Then it prints out the string and returns.  In other cases, it calculates whether the
character at the given index can be a zero.  If so, it sets it to zero and recursively calls
<b>do_enumeration()</b> with an incremented index, and the same number-of-ones.
<p>
When that recursive call returns, it determines if the character at the given index can
be a one.  If so, it sets it to one and recursively calls
<b>do_enumeration()</b> with an incremented index, and the with  number-of-ones decremented by
one.  
<p>
That's all there is to it.

<h2>Part 2: ShapeShifter!!</h2>

<h3>The Game</h3>
In <a href=http://www.neopets.com>neopets.com</a>, there is a game called
<a href=http://www.neopets.com/medieval/shapeshifter_index.phtml>"ShapeShifter."</a>  
I won't screen-dump their pictures, since that probably violates a few copyrights, 
so I'll explain the game using my own pictures.  You are given a setup like
below, consisting of grid of swords and shields, an "active shape", and some
"remaining shapes":

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Pic-1.jpg width=400></td></table></center><p>

You apply the active shape to a part of the grid where it fits.  For example, in the
picture above, you can apply the active shape to row zero, row one or row two (life
is zero-indexed, of course).  When you apply the shape, all grid cells that the shape
overlaps change swords to shields and vice versa.  For example, suppose you apply the
active shape to row zero.  The state of the system then changes to:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Pic-2.jpg width=400></td></table></center><p>

The next shape can be applied to row 0 or row 1.  Suppose we apply it to row 1.  Now
the state of the system is:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Pic-3.jpg width=400></td></table></center><p>

There is one more shape, which can be applied to columns 0, 1 or 2.  We
apply it do column zero, and the grid becomes all swords:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Pic-4.jpg width=400></td></table></center><p>

Those are the mechanics of the game.  You are given a grid of swords and shields and
a collection of shapes.  Your goal is to apply <i>all</i> of the shapes to the grid
so that you end up with a grid of all swords.
<p>
Here's a second example:
<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Pic-5.jpg width=300></td></table></center><p>

There are nine places for that first shape to go.  Since I know the solution, 
I know it gets applied at row 1, column 1:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Pic-6.jpg width=300></td></table></center><p>

There are four places for the next shape -- we apply it to row 0, column 1:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src=Pic-7.jpg width=300></td></table></center><p>

I think you can figure out where that last shape goes.

<hr>
<h3>The Interactive Game Player</h3>

Since we are computer scientists, we are going to represent sheilds with zeros,
and swords with ones.  We will represent any rectangular grid of zeros and ones
that has <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns with a vector of <i>r</i> strings.
Each string in the vector has exactly <i>c</i> characters, which are either '0'
or '1'.  
<p>
Thus, the grid in our first example is:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
{ "100", "101", "000" }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

and the grid in the second example is:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
{ "100", "101", "001" }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We can also represent shapes as grids of zeros and ones.  For example, the shapes in the
first example are:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
{ "111" }
{ "110", "011" }
{ "1", "1", "1" }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

and the shapes in the second example are:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
{ "1" }
{ "11", "10" }
{ "01", "11" }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I have written an interactive game player, called <b>ss_player</b>, which takes a prompt and then 
a grid as command line arguments.
After the prompt, each word on the command line specifies a different row of the grid.  These words must all be
the same size, and they must be composed solely of zeros and ones.
Suppose I want to play using the first example above.  Then I can play with:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ss_player ShapeShifter: 100 101 000</b></font>

The Grid:

100
101
000

ShapeShifter: 
</pre>

At the prompt, I enter a shape and where to apply it.  Each row of the shape is a separate
word, and the last two words must specify a row and a column.  Below, I show how you would
specify the solution to the first example:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ss_player ShapeShifter: 100 101 000</b></font>

The Grid:

100
101
000

ShapeShifter: <font color=darkred><b>111 0 0</b></font>

The Grid:

011
101
000

ShapeShifter: <font color=darkred><b>110 011 1 0</b></font>

The Grid:

011
011
011

ShapeShifter: <font color=darkred><b>1 1 1 0 0</b></font>

The Grid:

111
111
111

ShapeShifter: <font color=darkred><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Go ahead and try to do the second example on your own.

<p>
If you give a prompt of "-", there will be no prompt, which is useful for when
you use the player with a file or output of a program as input.
<hr>
<h3>Your job: ss_solver</h3>

Your job is to write the program <b>ss_solver.cpp</b>.  It takes a grid on its command
line, and then each line of standard input specifies a shape.  After reading all of
the shapes, your program should output how to apply each shape to solve the 
puzzle.  It should ouptut the shapes in the same order as the input file.
If there is no solution, it should simply exit with no output.  
<p>
For example, the file 
<b><a href=ex1.txt>ex1.txt</a></b> contains the shapes for the first
example:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
111
110 011
1 1 1
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b><a href=ex2.txt>ex2.txt</a></b> contains the shapes for the second example.  
Here's the program running the two examples:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ss_solver 100 101 000 < ex1.txt</b></font>
111 0 0
110 011 1 0
1 1 1 0 0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ss_solver 100 101 001 < ex2.txt</b></font>
1 1 1
11 10 0 1
01 11 1 0
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Testing your program</h3>

The program <b>ss_random_game</b> generates a random game.  It takes four arguments -- rows,
columns, number of shapes, and whether the puzzle should be solvable.  That last argument
should either be "y" for "yes" or "u" for "unknown."
<p>
Here are two examples.  The first creates a 3x4 grid that is solvable with the given
pieces.  The second creates a 4x4 grid whose solvability is unknown.  The program <b>sed</b>
is used to strip out the first two lines of standard input.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ss_random_game</b></font>

UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Since there is no output from <b>ss_solver</b>, the puzzle is not solvable.

<hr>
<h3>ss_tester.sh</h3>

In the lab directory, there's a testing shell script called <b>ss_tester.sh</b>.  
This is what the grading script uses.  You call it with four arguments:
<UL>
<LI> Your solver
<LI> My solver
<LI> The player
<LI> An input file, which is in the same format as the output to <b>ss_random_test</b>.
</UL>

It then runs both your and my solver.  If my solver says its not solvable, yours should
too.  Otherwise, it uses the player to make sure that your solution works.  Your solution
should not have any extraneous output.  
<p>
When it is done running, there will be four new files:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>tmp-pieces.txt</b> -- these are the input pieces
<LI> <b>tmp-youroutput.txt</b> -- this is the output of your solver
<LI> <b>tmp-yourgame.txt</b> -- this is the output of the player on your solver
<LI> <b>tmp-yourpieces.txt</b> -- these are the pieces that you output.
</UL>
<p>
Here's an example -- I set the environment variable <b>l</b> so that I can use the programs
in the lab directory, and I don't have to type so much:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>$l/ss_random_game 4 4 4 y > tmp-test.txt</b></font>

The second program <b>badsolver2</b> solves the puzzle, but doesn't use the right
pieces:

If the tester fails, try to figure out why with the output files, and with my correct solver.
<hr>
<h3>The grading script</h3>

The grading script runs <b>ss_tester.sh</b> on various input files.  Some of them may take a
few seconds.  The <b>gradeall</b> script took 42 seconds for me on a hydra.  Yours shouldn't
take more than three minutes.  

<hr>
<h3>Program Structure</h3>

I'm going to let you structure this one yourself.  The only requirement
is that your program must use recursion.  Here's how I structured
mine (you don't have to do it this way):

<UL>
<LI> I had one main class, which is called a <b>ShapeShifter</b>.  It holds
the grid and the shapes, and has two important methods, listed below.
<p><LI> The first method is <b>Apply</b>, which applies a shape to the grid at a given
row and column.  It's really handy that if you call <b>Apply</b> with the same parameters
to the grid twice, you'll end up with the original grid.
<p><LI> The second method is <b>find_solution(index)</b>.  This is the recursive method.
If <b>index</b> is equal to the number of shapes, then you test to see if the grid is
all ones.  If so, you have success, and can print out the answer and exit.
If not, you return.
<p>
If <b>index</b> is less than the number of shapes, then you are going to apply the 
shape at every potential position, and after each application, you call the method
recursively on the next index.  If that call fails, then you call <b>Apply()</b> again
to undo the first <b>Apply()</b>, and then you try the next potential position.
</UL>
<p>
There are obviously other ways to structure this program, but that
seemed easiest to me.
