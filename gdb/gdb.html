<center><h1> How to Use gdb </h1>
<h2><a href=http://www.cs.utk.edu/~bvz>Brad Vander Zanden</a></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf">gdb cheat sheet</a>: contains quick summary of useful gdb commands.
<li> gdb does not run well on Macintoshes and may not run well on Window
  machines. I suggest that you use the hydra machines when you want to
  use gdb.
</ul>
<hr>
<b>gdb</b> is a GNU debugger that can be very helpful in finding problems
with your programs. It allows you to do a number of useful things including:
<p>
<ol>
<li> controlling the execution of your program by placing breakpoints and
single stepping your program.
<li> printing the values of variables in your program, and
<li> determining where a segmentation fault or bus error occurs in your
program.
</ol>
<p>
In CS102 you probably debugged your program by inserting print statements
into your program. While that technique often proves helpful, gdb provides
far more functionality and is worth learning. We will start you out with
a simple tutorial that shows you some of its features and then show you how
you can use it to help you with debugging. 
<p>
In order to use gdb you need to compile your files with the -g option. For
example:
<pre>
gcc -g -c student1.c
gcc -o student1 student1.o
</pre>
<p>
<hr>
<h2> A Sample GDB Session </h2>
<p>
Start by copying the files in ~bvz/cs140/gdb to your directory
and then typing <b>make</b>. <tt>make</tt> should compile the sample files
in your directory into executables.
<p>
Now type:
<pre>
./names_list
</pre>
<tt>names_list</tt> prompts the user for five names and prepends the
names to a list. The list starts with a sentinel node. The program
then prints the names in the reverse order from which
they were entered. 
In
this case <tt>names_list</tt> has nothing wrong with it. We simply want
to use it to show you the various ways in which you can use gdb. 
After that
we will show you how you can use gdb to debug programs.
<p>
To use gdb with <tt>names_list</tt>, type
<pre>
gdb names_list
</pre>
<b>gdb</b> is the command you type to invoke the gdb debugger and 
<tt>names_list</tt> is the name of the executable you wish to debug. 
<p>
<hr>
<h3> Listing the lines in a program </h3>
<p>
You can list the lines in your program
using the <tt>list</tt> command, or <tt>l</tt> for short.
<tt>list</tt> lists 10 lines of your program, centered about the next line to 
be executed. If you do it now, it will probably list the first 10 lines in
your file since your program has not yet started execution. You can make it
<pre>
l first_line_number, last_line_number
</pre>
For example, typing <tt>l 10,23</tt> will cause gdb to list lines 10-23 of
the current file. 
<p>
Sometimes you will want to list the lines in a different file. For example,
<tt>names_list</tt> consists of the two files <tt>list.cpp</tt> and
<tt>add_name.cpp</tt>. The file that was listed defaults to <tt>list.cpp</tt> 
because that was the first file I gave to gcc. However, I can look at lines
in <tt>add_name.cpp</tt> by prefixing the line numbers with add_name.cpp. For
example:
<pre>
l add_name.cpp:6,12
</pre>
<hr>
<h2> Executing a Program in GDB </h2>
<p>
You start running a program using gdb's <tt>run</tt> command or <tt>r</tt>
for short. Try it now on the <tt>names_list</tt> program. Simply type 
<tt>r</tt> at the gdb prompt:
<pre>
(gdb) r
</pre>
<tt>names_list</tt> does not require any command line arguments but if
you have a program that requires command line arguments, you list 
them after the <tt>run</tt> command. For example:
<pre>
r 3 gradefile
</pre>
<p>
If your program is seg faulting then the run command will probably suffice
to start your debugging session. When the program seg faults gdb will tell
you the file, the procedure, and the line number where the seg fault occurred.
We will explore debugging later. For the time being we will concentrate on
showing you how you can control the execution of a program using gdb.
<p>
Frequently you will want to stop the program at some point during its
execution and start single-stepping it. You can cause the program to stop
at a certain line or when a certain function is called by creating
breakpoints. A breakpoint is created using the <tt>break</tt> command
or <tt>b</tt> for short.
It takes either a line number or a function as an argument. For example,
each of the follow commands will set a breakpoint in the names_list
program:
<pre>
b 15                  <span class="comment">// set a breakpoint at line 15 in the current file</span>
b add_name_to_list    <span class="comment">// set a breakpoint on the function add_name_to_list</span>
b add_name.cpp:8      <span class="comment">// set a breakpoint at line 8 in add_name.cpp</comment>
</pre>
When you place a breakpoint on a function, such as <tt>add_name_to_list</tt>,
gdb will stop the program any time that the function <tt>add_name_to_list</tt>
is called, no matter where in the program <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> is called.
<p>
When a breakpoint is created gdb will assign it a number. If you want to
later delete the breakpoint you can do so by typing <tt>delete</tt> and
the breakpoint number. Alternatively you can type <tt>clear</tt> and
either the line number or the function to which the breakpoint is
attached. For example:
<pre>
delete 1
clear add_name_to_list
clear add_name.cpp:8
</pre>
These three commands will delete the three breakpoints created earlier.
<p>
If you forget what breakpoints you have set, you can type <tt>info b</tt>
to print the breakpoints. For example:
<pre>
(gdb) info b
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000000400b2b in main() at list.cpp:8
(gdb) 
</pre>
The <tt>Disp</tt> field is short for <tt>Disposition</tt> and indicates 
whether the breakpoint is marked to be 
disabled or deleted when it is next encountered. The <tt>Enb</tt> field is
short for <tt>Enabled</tt> and indicates whether or not the breakpoint is
currently enabled. You do not need to worry about either of these fields.
The <tt>What</tt> field tells you where the breakpoint is set, and that
information, plus the number of the breakpoint, are probably the two pieces
of information you need.
<p>
<hr>
<h3> Continuing from a Breakpoint </h3>
<p>
You can cause the program to continue executing and proceed to the next
breakpoint by typing <tt>continue</tt>, or <tt>c</tt> for short. Try it
out by re-instating the breakpoints you typed in previously, re-starting the
program, and then typing <tt>c</tt> each time you reach a breakpoint. You
will need to re-type the previous breakpoints if you deleted them.
<p>
<hr>
<h3> Printing the Values of Variables </h3>
<p>
You can print the values of variables in gdb using the <tt>print</tt> 
command, or <tt>p</tt> for short. You print items just as you would reference
them in a C program. However, unlike printf, you do not have to provide
formatting information.
<p>
To try out the printing command first delete your previous
breakpoints and place a breakpoint at line 21 in list.cpp. Now re-run
your program from scratch and enter a name when prompted. The program
will break at line 21:
<pre>
(gdb) r
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
 
Starting program: /home/bvz/courses/140/sp16/gdb/names_list
enter a name: brad

Breakpoint 1, main () at list.cpp:21
21		add_name_to_list(name_list, name); 
(gdb)
</pre>
Now let's print the contents of <tt>name_list</tt> and <tt>name</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) p name_list
$1 = (listNode *) 0x603010
(gdb) p name
$2 = "brad"
(gdb)
</pre>
<tt>name_list</tt> is a pointer which points to memory starting at
0x603010 and <tt>name</tt> is the string that I just typed in at the prompt.
We can see that "brad" was
properly read into <tt>name</tt>. The memory address you see may be 
different than mine because your program may be allocated a different
part of memory than mine was. Throughout this tutorial, you should expect
your memory addresses to differ from the ones shown in this tutorial.
<p>
We can print the contents of the node pointed to by name_list by dereferencing
the pointer:
<pre>
(gdb) p *name_list
$3 = {name = "", next = 0x0}
</pre>
Remember that our list has a sentinel node so everything is as it should be.
The sentinel node's <tt>next</tt> field is the null pointer, thus making
it an empty list. 
<p>
If you want to examine all of the local variables in the function, you
can type <tt>info locals</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) info locals
i = 0
name = "brad"
name_list = 0x603010
name_list_ptr = 0x400d10 &lt;__libc_csu_init&gt;
</pre>
Note that <tt>i</tt> and <tt>name_list_ptr</tt> both have values, even though
they have not been initialized. It would be nice if gdb would mark them as
uninitialized, but you don't always get what you want in life. Since <tt>i</tt>
and <tt>name_list_ptr</tt> are uninitialized, you can't count on them always
having reasonable values. For example, when I tried to see what memory 
was pointed to by <tt>name_list_ptr</tt>, I got the following:
<pre>
(gdb) p *name_list_ptr
$4 = {
  name = <error reading variable: Cannot access memory at address 0x495641ff89415729>, next = 0x41d589495541f689}
</pre>
In other words, <tt>name_list_ptr</tt> does not point to a legitimate memory
object.
<p>
Let's continue with our program's execution. Type <tt>continue</tt>, or <tt>c</tt>, and enter another name:
<pre>
(gdb) c
Continuing.
enter a name: nels
 
Breakpoint 1, main () at list.cpp:21
18              add_name_to_list(name_list, name);
(gdb)
</pre>
At this point "brad" should have been added to the list but "nels" should
not yet have been added to the list. However, "nels" should be contained in
name. We can check all this out using the print command:
<pre>
(gdb) p name   
$16 = "nels"                       <span class="comment">// "nels" is in name as it should be</span>
(gdb) p *name_list
$5 = {name = "", next = 0x603090}  <span class="comment">// the sentinel node points to something</span>
(gdb) p *name_list->next           <span class="comment">// and that something is "brad"</span>
$6 = {name = "brad", next = 0x0}
(gdb)
</pre>
Note that brad's node does not point to anything, which is correct. Also
note how I was able to "chase" a pointer by typing 
<pre>
p *name_list->next
</pre>
<p>
Let's try one more iteration of the program:
<pre>
(gdb) c
Continuing.
enter a name: pat
 
Breakpoint 1, main () at list.cpp:21
18              add_name_to_list(name_list, name);
(gdb) p *name_list->next
$7 = {name = "nels", next = 0x603090}      <span class="comment">// the first node is "nels"</span>
(gdb) p *name_list->next->next 
$8 = {name = "brad", next = 0x0}           <span class="comment">// the second node is "brad"</span>
(gdb) p name    
$9 = "pat"                                 <span class="comment">// "pat" is in name</span>
(gdb)
</pre>
Notice that I can get arbitrarily far in the list by typing a series of
<tt>next's</tt>. 
<p>
<hr>
<h3> Single Stepping Through a Program </h3>
<p>
Once you have gotten a program to stop you will often want to single step
through the program, executing one statement at a time, rather than 
continuing to the next breakpoint. gdb provides you
with two commands for doing so: 
<ol>
<li> <tt>step</tt> (<tt>s</tt> for short): step
executes each statement and, if it encounters a function call, it will step
into the function, thus allowing you to follow the flow-of-control into
subroutines. 
<p>
<li><tt>next</tt> (<tt>n</tt> for short): next also executes each
statement but if it encounters a function call it will execute the function
as an atomic statement. In other words, it will execute all the
statements in the function and in any functions that that function might call.
It will seem as though you typed
<tt>continue</tt> with a breakpoint set at the next statement. The one
exception to this statement is that if there is a breakpoint nested in
the function, then gdb will break when it reaches that breakpoint.
</ol>
<p>
To see the difference between the two types of commands, re-run your
program from scratch by typing <tt>r</tt>. 
It should break after it prompts you for a name and you enter one:
<pre>
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/bvz/courses/140/sp16/gdb/names_list 
enter a name: brad
 
Breakpoint 1, main () at list.cpp:21
21              add_name_to_list(name_list, name);
</pre>
First try using the <tt>step</tt> command:
<pre>
(gdb) s
add_name_to_list (names=0x603010, name_to_add="brad") at add_name.cpp:7
7	    listNode *new_node = new listNode;
(gdb)
</pre> 
We have stepped into the function <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> and are about
to execute the first statement. Before executing this statement try printing
<tt>new_node</tt>. Since it has not been initialized, it will have a random
value. When I printed the value of <tt>new_node</tt> I got the following result:
<pre>
(gdb) p new_node
$9 = (listNode *) 0x400a30 &lt;_start&gt;
</pre>
Now execute the first statement in <tt>add_name_to_list</tt>
by typing <tt>s</tt>:
<pre>
listNode::listNode (this=0x603090) at list.h:5
5	class listNode {
</pre>
What's happening? gdb is executing the first statement in <tt>add_name_to_list</tt>, which is line 7:
<pre>
listNode *new_node = new listNode;
</pre>
Note the call to <tt>new</tt>, which creates a new <tt>listNode</tt>. When
a new <tt>listNode</tt> is created, its constructor gets called. This call
to the constructor is what is being printed by gdb when you see:
<pre>
listNode::listNode (this=0x603090) at list.h:5
</pre>
The <tt>this</tt> variable is an implicit parameter passed to every constructor
that gives the address of the newly allocated object.
<p>
Type <tt>s</tt> again:
<pre>
(gdb) s
add_name_to_list (names=0x603010, name_to_add="brad") at add_name.cpp:9
9	    new_node->name = name_to_add;
</pre>
Since the constructor for <tt>listNode</tt> is empty, we immediately step
out of the constructor and back into <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> at its next
executable statement, which is line 9.
<p>
Try printing out
the new value of <tt>new_node</tt> and the contents of the memory pointed
to by <tt>new_node</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) p new_node
$10 = (listNode *) 0x603090
(gdb) p *new_node
$11 = {name = "", next = 0x0}
(gdb)
</pre>
Notice that <tt>new_node</tt> has the same memory address as the <tt>this</tt>
variable in <tt>listNode</tt>'s constructor. That's because <tt>0x603090</tt>
is the memory address of the object allocated by new. It was the memory 
address passed to the constructor and also assigned to <tt>new_node</tt>.
Also
note that the contents of <tt>new_node</tt> have 
reasonable values. string objects are automatically initialized to the empty
string but it is purely luck that <tt>next</tt> is a null pointer as
opposed to a random memory address. It's possible that when you run your
own program, that <tt>next</tt> will point to something random.
<p>
Here is a helpful shortcut you can use while single-stepping. 
Type <tt>s</tt> to execute line 9.
Now hit return a couple times until you reach statement 12 with the empty
right curly brace, }. Notice that it single-steps for you. gdb remembers
the last command that you entered and if you hit return, it will repeat that
command. This feature is handy when you want to single-step through a number
of statements. 
<p>
You should now be at line 12, which is the end of the function.
Let us make sure that the new
node was prepended to the list and that it has the appropriate memory
contents:
<pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>(gdb) p *names</td><td><span class="comment">// print the sentinel node for the names list</span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>$1 = {name = "", next = 0x603090}</td><td><span class="comment">// it points to our new node</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>(gdb) p *names->next</td><td><span class="comment">// now look at the first node in the list</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>$2 = {name = "brad", next = 0x0}</td></tr>
</table>
</pre>
Everything looks fine. You might wonder why we indirectly checked the contents
of the new node by typing <tt>p *names->next</tt> rather than by 
typing <tt>p new_node</tt>. To see why, try to print new_node:
<pre>
(gdb) p new_node
No symbol "new_node" in current context.
</pre>
This seems odd. Why is <tt>new_node</tt> not defined? The reason is that
we have exited the scope of the block defined by the initial { in the
function. When we exited this block, <tt>new_node</tt> went out of scope.
We are still in the function, albeit at its end, so we can still see the
function's parameters. That's why we used the <tt>names</tt> pointer to
check everything.
<p>
Let's continue by typing <tt>c</tt>
<pre>
(gdb) c
Continuing.
enter a name: nels
 
Breakpoint 1, main () at list.cpp:21
21              add_name_to_list(name_list, name);
(gdb)
</pre>
This time we will single step by using <tt>next</tt> rather than <tt>step</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) n
18          for (i = 0; i < NUM_NAMES; i++) {
(gdb)
</pre>
Notice that we have executed <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> without stepping
into it and have now gone to the top of the loop. Let's make sure
everything worked before we continue:
<pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>(gdb) p *name_list</td><td><span class="comment">// print the sentinel node so we can find the first node in the list</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>$3 = {name = "", next = 0x6030e0}</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>(gdb) p *name_list->next</td><td><span class="comment">// the first node should be the new node</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>$4 = {name = "nels", next = 0x603090}</td><td><span class="comment">// it is</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>(gdb) p *name_list->next->next</td><td><span class="comment">// now check the second node</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>$5 = {name = "brad", next = 0x0}</td><td><span class="comment">// it's also ok</td></tr>
</table>
</pre>
Note that the <tt>next</tt> field for the new node 
points to the previous node we prepended. If you do not believe me, check
the memory address, which is 0x603090, with the memory address that was
given to new_node the first time we visited <tt>add_name_to_list</tt>. They
are the same. 
<p>
Instead of typing continue, try typing <tt>n</tt> a couple more times until
cin gets executed:
<pre>
(gdb) n
19             printf("enter a name: ");
(gdb) n
20             cin >> name;
(gdb) n
enter a name: sue
</pre>
First, note that the prompt string is not printed until you execute the
cin statement. That is because C++ buffers output until 1) a newline character
is encountered, or 2) the output exceeds a certain length, or 3) something
occurs that forces the output to be printed, such as a cin statement.
<p>
Also note that if you are using an older version of gdb, that you could 
get an error message when you entered "sue". The problem with the older versions
of gdb is that they will only give THE FIRST CHARACTER to
cin and then they will try to interpret the rest of the character
string. If you encounter this problem, you can circumvent it by placing a
breakpoint <b>after</b> the statements which read keyboard input and "continue"
through them.  Doing so will allow all the keyboard input to be read in before
control is returned to you. Notice that I cleverly told you to place your
breakpoint at line 21, which is the first statement after the cin. 
<p>

<h2> Determining Your Location in a Program </h2>
<p>
You can find where you are in a program using the <tt>backtrace</tt> command
or <tt>bt</tt> for short. The backtrace command will show you the current
stack of functions that are active. For example, re-create the breakpoint
at line 10 of <tt>add_name</tt> 
and then run the program until it reaches the breakpoint:
<pre>
(gdb) b add_name.cpp:10
Breakpoint 2 at 0x400ccb: file add_name.cpp, line 10.

(gdb) r
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

Starting program: /home/bvz/courses/140/sp16/gdb/names_list 

enter a name: brad
 
Breakpoint 1, main () at list.cpp:21
21              add_name_to_list(name_list, name);
(gdb) c
Continuing.
 
Breakpoint 2, add_name_to_list (names=0x603010, name_to_add="brad")
    at add_name.cpp:10
10	    new_node->next = names->next;
(gdb)
</pre>
Now type <tt>backtrace</tt>, or <tt>bt</tt> for short:
<pre>
(gdb) bt
#0  add_name_to_list (names=0x603010, name_to_add="brad") at add_name.cpp:10
#1  0x0000000000400b98 in main () at list.cpp:21
(gdb)
</pre>
It tells you that you are currently in <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> at line 10 in 
<tt>add_name.cpp</tt> and that <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> was called from
<tt>main</tt> at line 21 in <tt>list.cpp</tt>. Note that the backtrace command 
also tells you the values of the arguments passed to each active function. 
<tt>backtrace</tt> is typically the first command you will type when
debugging a seg fault or bus error because you will want some idea of where
you are in the program. 
<p>
You can use the <tt>up</tt> and <tt>down</tt> commands to move around in
the stack. These commands are necessary if you want to print a variable that
is local to another function. For example, if I try to print <tt>main's name</tt>
variable while I'm stopped at the current breakpoint, I should get the
following error message:
<pre>
(gdb) p name
No symbol "name" in current context.
(gdb)
</pre>
although you might also see something like:
<pre>
(gdb) p name
$7 = '\000' <repeats 32 times>
</pre>
which is nonsense.
However, if I type "<tt>frame 1</tt>" I will be moved up to the stack record for
main. I can then print the value of <tt>name</tt>:
<pre>
#1  0x0000000000400b98 in main () at list.cpp:21
21		add_name_to_list(name_list, name);
(gdb) p name
$8 = "brad"
</pre>
<hr>
<h2> Debugging Programs </h2>
<p>
Now that you've learned the basics of gdb, let's see how you can use it to
debug a program. Quit gdb and then re-enter it using the program
<tt>segfault1</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) q
The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y
cetus3> gdb segfault1

(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/bvz/courses/140/sp16/gdb/segfault1 

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000400604 in main () at segfault1.cpp:6
6	    *number = 10;
</pre>
gdb tells us that we received a segfault at line 6 in segfault1.cpp. It also
shows us that the statement being executed was <tt>*number = 10</tt>. The
fact that we are trying to assign to a dereferenced pointer should give
us a strong clue that the pointer does not point to a legitimate piece of
memory. We can test our hypothesis by checking the memory address pointed
to by <tt>number</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) p number
$1 = (int *) 0x0
(gdb)
</pre>
Sure enough, <tt>number</tt> is a null pointer, which means that we have not
allocated memory for it using <tt>malloc</tt>. Try changing 
<tt>segfault1.c</tt> so that it calls the new operator to create a new
int object and assigns it to <tt>number</tt> before trying to assign
10 to it. Re-compile and re-run the program. It should work and print out 10.
<p>
<hr>
<h2> Debugging a Program with Array Overflow </h2>
<p>
In CS102 and perhaps even in CS140 you have encountered problems with stepping
past the end of an array and your program seg faulting. gdb can help you
determine where the program is seg faulting and by doing some investigating,
it might help you determine the source of the error. 
<p>
Try running <tt>bad_names_list</tt>. It has an array big enough to hold 3
names. Try entering 4 names:
<pre>
hydra4.eecs.utk.edu> gdb bad_names_list

(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/bvz/courses/140/sp16/gdb/bad_names_list 

enter a name: brad
enter a name: peggy
enter a name: sue
enter a name: jack

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff7b8fd75 in ?? () from /lib64/libstdc++.so.6
</pre>
What went wrong? The first thing we should do is try to find what line was
executing in our program when the program crashed. Note that the program
seg faulted in a function called <tt>/lib64/libstdc++.so.6</tt>. This
is clearly not a function that we wrote. Use the backtrace command to
print the stack:
<pre>
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007ffff7b8fd75 in ?? () from /lib64/libstdc++.so.6
#1  0x00007ffff7b9103e in std::string::assign(std::string const&) ()
   from /lib64/libstdc++.so.6
#2  0x0000000000400c06 in main () at list1.cpp:17
</pre>
We can see that we were executing line 17 in <tt>list1.cpp</tt> when
the program crashed. Let's print this line:
<pre>
(gdb) l list1.cpp:17
12	    int num_names = 0;
13	    int i;
14	
15	    printf("enter a name: ");
16	    while (cin >> name) {
17		name_list[num_names] = name;
18	        printf("enter a name: ");
19		num_names++;
20	    }
21	
</pre>
We see that line 17 attempted to assign <tt>name</tt> to our <tt>name_list</tt>
array. In these situations, it's best to print the names of all of our
"suspects", which are all of our variables in the statement: <tt>name_list</tt>,
<tt>num_names</tt>, and <tt>name</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) frame 2
#2  0x0000000000400c06 in main () at list1.cpp:17
17		name_list[num_names] = name;
(gdb) info locals
name = "jack"
name_list = {"brad", "peggy", "sue"}
num_names = 3
i = 0
</pre>
Notice that I first had to type <tt>frame 2</tt> to get to the frame containing
my main function. Then I typed <tt>info locals</tt> because it was easier
than individually printing my three variables. 
<p>
The resulting print-out may or may not lead you to the error. In this case
the problem is that the <tt>name_list</tt> array can hold only three names,
and I'm trying to assign a fourth name to it at index location 3 (the value
of <tt>num_names</tt>). Since this location is past the end of the array,
the code seg faults.

<h2> Debugging an Infinite Loop </h2>
<p>
gdb can also be useful in situations where the program does not crash, but
instead has a logic error that causes unexpected output or unexpected
behavior, such as an infinite loop. I have created a new file named 
<tt>add_name1.cpp</tt> that contains a logic error which introduces an
infinite loop and compiled it with <tt>list.cpp</tt> into an executable
called <tt>bad_names_list1</tt>. Like <tt>names_list</tt> it is supposed
to read 5 names and then print them out in reverse order. However, when it
reaches the fifth name, it instead goes into an infinite loop printing out
the last name that we entered. 
<p>
First try running the program and entering 5 names. You can type <tt>Ctrl-D</tt>
to stop the program's infinite execution:
<pre>
enter a name: joe
enter a name: frank
enter a name: nancy
enter a name: sue
enter a name: yifan
yifan
yifan
yifan
yifan
yifan
...
</pre>
Let's run the program in gdb. In order to use gdb effectively in such
situations, we need to form a hypothesis about what is wrong with the
program. Since the program enters an infinite loop when it starts printing
the list, a natural hypothesis is that something is wrong with our list
of names. If we look in <tt>list.cpp</tt>, we find that the for loop for
printing the names starts at line 24, so let's put a breakpoint at that line
and then run the program until we reach that line:
<pre>
hydra4> gdb bad_names_list1
(gdb) b 24
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400ba2: file list.cpp, line 24.

(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/bvz/courses/140/sp16/gdb/bad_names_list1 

enter a name: joe
enter a name: frank
enter a name: nancy
enter a name: sue
enter a name: yifan

Breakpoint 1, main () at list.cpp:24
24	    for (name_list_ptr = name_list->next;
</pre>
<p>
Now let's start printing our list manually using gdb. We will start by
printing the sentinel node:
<pre>
(gdb) p *name_list
$2 = {name = "", next = 0x6031d0}
</pre>
That looks fine--the name field is empty and <tt>next</tt> appears to be
pointing to something. Now let's print the first node in the list:
<pre>
(gdb) p *name_list->next
$3 = {name = "yifan", next = 0x6031d0}
</pre>
The name field looks right--it's "yifan". Remember that we are prepending names
to the list, so "yifan" should be the first node in the list. If you're
paying close attention to what's been printed thus far, you may notice 
something funny about the <tt>next</tt> field. However, if you don't see
anything wrong yet, then try printing the second node:
<pre>
(gdb) p *name_list->next->next
$4 = {name = "yifan", next = 0x6031d0}
</pre>
Hmm, that doesn't look right. The second node also appears to be "yifan". 
Maybe now is the time to look more closely at that <tt>next</tt> field.
Look at the value of "yifan"'s next field and the value of the sentinel
node's next field. Notice that they point to the same memory address and
this memory address must be yifan's node. In other words, yifan's node
points back to itself rather than pointing to sue's node.
<p>
At this point we have confirmed our hypothesis that the list has been
improperly constructed. We should also be able to understand why the
for loop is an infinite loop that always prints yifan. At each step, the
list pointer is being made to point to yifan, and hence the for loop never
exits and the loop body always prints the string "yifan". 
<p> 
You should now suspect that there is a problem in the function
<tt>add_name_to_list</tt>, which is located in <tt>add_name1.cpp</tt>.
If you look at the code in that function, I hope you can figure out what
is wrong by manually inspecting the code. However, suppose that you
cannot do so. You can use gdb to help you figure out what's wrong.
<p>
To do so, you'll need to re-start the program and put a breakpoint on the
<tt>add_name_to_list</tt> function:
<pre>
(gdb) b add_name_to_list
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400c9f: file add_name1.cpp, line 7.

(gdb) r
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

Starting program: /home/bvz/courses/140/sp16/gdb/bad_names_list1 

enter a name: joe

Breakpoint 1, add_name_to_list (names=0x603010, name_to_add="joe")
    at add_name1.cpp:7
7	    listNode *new_node = new listNode;
(gdb) 
</pre>
The problem seems to be in how we link the list, so let's use the <tt>next</tt>
command to skip ahead until we reach the first linking statement, which is
statement 10. I've also printed <tt>new_node</tt> and the contents of
<tt>new_node</tt> when I reach statement 10,
just to make sure everything looks okay (it does):
<pre>
(gdb) n
9	    new_node->name = name_to_add;
(gdb) n
10	    names->next = new_node;
(gdb) p new_node
$0 = (listNode *) 0x603090
(gdb) p *new_node
$1 = {name = "joe", next = 0x0}
</pre>
If we inspect statement 10, we can see that it is making the list's sentinel
node point to joe's node. That's fine--we want to prepend joe to the front of 
the list. Let's execute statement 10 and make sure it worked by printing
the first node of the list:
<pre>
(gdb) n
11	    new_node->next = names->next;
(gdb) print *names->next
$2 = {name = "joe", next = 0x0}
</pre>
So far, so good. Let's move on to the next linking statement, which is
statement 11. statement 11 is supposed to make joe point to the next
node in the list. Since the list was previously empty, joe should point
to the sentinel node, which we will check by printing the contents of
<tt>new_node->next</tt>:
<pre>
(gdb) n
12	}
(gdb) print *new_node->next
No symbol "new_node" in current context.
</pre>
ARGHHHHHHH! I hate it when gdb does this. We have reached the end of the
function and gdb has already de-allocated the <tt>new_node</tt> variable.
You have two choices here. First you can add a useless statement, such as
a printf statement, to the
end of the <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> function so that the function does not
end at line 12. That way <tt>new_node</tt> will still be available for you
to examine. However, I don't want to waste my time adding a new statement
to <tt>add_name_to_list</tt> and re-compiling it. 
<p>
I have a better idea. I know that joe is the first node on the list and that
joe should point to the sentinel node. So the sentinel node should be the
"second" node on the list (I put "second" in parentheses because the list
only has one value and the sentinel node marks the end of the list). Therefore
I can print the second node of the list as follows:
<pre>
(gdb) print *names->next->next
$3 = {name = "joe", next = 0x603090}
</pre>
Hmm. That does not look too good. The second node is "joe", not the sentinel
node. Hopefully at this point we flash back to our earlier exploration with
yifan and realize that joe must be pointing to himself. If you don't believe
me, you can re-run the program, and before you execute statement 11, print
the address of joe's object (you can do that by printing <tt>new_node</tt>).
You will then find for certain that joe is pointing to himself. 
<p>
You now know that statement 11 is not working properly. At this point gdb
cannot help you any longer. It has given you all the information it can
provide and you will have to puzzle out the problem from here. Hopefully
you can. If you can't figure it out, the lab TA will cover the solution
in lab.

<h2> A Final Debugging Tip </h2>
<p>
When something goes wrong in a program, it often helps to try to come up
with the simplest possible set of inputs that can reproduce the problem. In 
<tt>bad_names_list1</tt> you had to enter 5 names before discovering that
something is wrong. Since the program expects 5 names, you can't make the
input any shorter. However, you might realize that you could change the
constant <tt>NUM_NAMES</tt> in <tt>list.cpp</tt> so that it is 1 rather than
5 and then see if the problem occurs with 1 input. Indeed it does, and that
could help simplify your debugging task. In this case the problem was so
simple that the simplification would not really help. However, in lab I
see many of you start your testing by using Dr. Plank's test cases, rather
than constructing your own simple examples and using the test editors that
he provides you with. Only after testing your simple examples and getting
your program to work with them should you move on to his test cases. When
one of his test cases fails, you can often make your debugging job easier
if you can simplify his test file by removing one or more commands. This is
what I frequently do when I help you with one of his test cases. I keep
removing commands until I have the simplest possible file that causes the
same error. Once I have this simpler file, I start trying to find the source
of the problem. The simpler file means that far fewer statements might be
responsible for the bug and makes it easier for me to find your error.
