Today's lecture will cover <b>gcc</b>, the GNU project's C compiler, and
<b>gdb</b>, their debugging tool. Also <b>purify</b> and <b>quantify</b>, 
tools to help in debugging and optimizing code.  First, perform the setup
from the lecture links.
This should copy to your new directory some files, create 2 subdirectories and 
then compile multiple executables.
</p>
<p>
Then I suggest that you read the disclaimer on the <b>gcc</b> man page about 
currency. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>GCC The GNU Compiler</h3><br>
<b>gcc</b> assumes that the source file for C code has an extension of <b>.c</b>
and given that extension, it runs the preprocessor, compiles and assembles 
the file, producing an executable "a.out" unless you specify 
otherwise.  
<pre>

  gcc myfile.c

</pre> 
produces an executable "a.out" and any intermediate files that my be
needed are written to /tmp and removed before the compiler finishes.  All 
the compilers
in use on our system take a number of command line options and gcc is no
exception.  Three of the most important, or most used, are <b>-o, -c </b>and <b>-g</b>.  
-o is used to specify the name of the output file (executable or
object file).  -c is used when you only wish to generate an object (.o)
file and, by default, uses the base name of the input file.  Thus if I
were to use 
<pre>

  gcc -c myfile.c

</pre> 
I would generate a file "myfile.o".  This name can be changed using the -o
option 
<pre>

  gcc -c myfile.c -o test.o

</pre> 
will generate the file test.o.  To this you may answer <i>So?</i>  but there
will come a time when you want/need to rename an output.  
</p>
<p>
The -g option is used when debugging information is needed.  In order to
run any of the debuggers available to us, some information,
particularly source file line numbering, is necessary in executable
code.  This information requires extra time to generate and is sometimes
incompatible with optimizations you may specify or that the compiler
may attempt so that the code produced tends to run more slowly.  But
since you are debugging it, it must not be running well anyway so speed
is not an issue.
</p>
<p>

There are very few restrictions regarding placement of command line
options but I suggest that you do the following.  First place any
switches such as -g, -O, -DADD_ that affect the overall operation of the
compiler, then switches regarding the file(s) such as -c and -o.  Last
place the library switches.
</p>
<p>

The examples I have given previously are extremely simple and don't
really give you a flavor of the possibilities, or quirks, that can be
encountered.  You will have to refer to the man page, even though it is
only about 90% percent accurate (in my opinion) and ask friends.  
</p>
<p>

So why should you generate object files instead of making executables
directly?  The best reason is that for large projects it allows the
compilation (I hope you are using make) to only be done for those
source files you have modified.  A "normal" thing to do is to have the
executable dependent upon the object files of the sources.  Then when a
source is modified only that one is recompiled and the executable is
re-linked to the new object.  This also means that by breaking up source
files, if you have made errors in writing the code you don't get errors for 
all the code at once but can handle smaller quantities at a time.  It
also causes you to think more modularly, keep functions which do similar
things in the same file so they can be easily reused, that sort of thing.
</p>
<p>
Enough talk, some examples.
<pre>

  gcc -O2 -DDEBUG -I$HOME/mydir/include myfile.o myfile2.o -L$HOME/mydir/lib 
  -lmylib      

</pre> 
<p>
So what does this do?  First the -O2 (note a capital o) says use
optimization level 2, depending on the compiler this can have the values
of -O -O2 -O3  and read the man pages for what each one does.  The
next -DDEBUG  is equivalent to putting the statement 
<pre>

#define DEBUG 1

</pre> 
at the beginning of your code and is very useful for debugging/examining
values in that it will allow conditional compilation.  In your code you
may place statements such as the following
<pre>

#ifdef DEBUG
  printf("val=%d\n",val);
#endif

#ifndef DEBUG
#define DEBUG 1
#endif

#if (DEBUG==1)
  printf("val=%d\n",val);
#else
  printf("no debug\n")
#endif

</pre> 
<p>
The <b>#ifdef</b> and <b>#ifndef</b> are "if defined" and "if not defined" and 
cause the code which follows, until the corresponding <b>#else</b> or 
<b>#endif</b>, to be compiled or not based on the result of the test.  
The <b>#if</b> can use any of the normal C boolean 
operations '>' '<' '==' '!'  and combinations.  And the values do not have to 
be <b>#defined</b> but must be able to be evaluated the
same as in any C conditional statement.  There is also an <b>#elif</b> (else
if) which can be used on conjunction with these.
</p>
<p>

The <b>-I</b> switch tells the compiler that in addition to the directories it
normally looks in for #include files, which normal files are specified by
<pre>

#include <stdio.h>

</pre> 
also now look in the <b>-I</b> directories.  Files specified with
<pre>

#include "myinclude.h"

</pre> 
are normally looked for in the current directory (the one the
source file is in) the 'normal' directories. Now the <b>-I</b> directories will 
also be searched.  Multiple directories may be specified in this way.  
<b>-L</b> does the same as <b>-I</b> only for library directories 
instead of include directories.  The 
compiler adds the <b>-L</b> directories to the list it searches for
 <b>-l[name]</b> libraries. <b>-l</b> tells the compiler to include the 
library <b>[name]</b> in
those libraries it uses for linking.  Actually it will search its list
of directories for a file name lib[name].a .  For instance placing -lm
specifies to that the math library should be used.  This contains functions
such sqrt().
<p>

One thing to understand, when multiple .o files are specified the entire
contents of the files are incorporated into the executable, whether the
code (functions) is used or not.  With libraries however, only the
applicable code is used, not the entire library.

</p>

<pre>
Try the following compilations, run the resulting a.out files and look at
the source file.  These are examples of the #define and #ifdef
statements.

UNIX> gcc -DDEBUG comp_test.c
UNIX> a.out
-DDEBUG was in the compile line
UNIX> gcc -DDEBUG=2 -DONE=2 comp_test.c
UNIX> a.out
-DDEBUG was in the compile line
DEBUG had a value greater than 1
UNIX> gcc -DDEBUG -DONE comp_test.c
UNIX> a.out
-DDEBUG was in the compile line
DEBUG had a value equal to ONE
UNIX> gcc comp_test.c
UNIX> a.out
DEBUG had a value equal to ONE
-DDEBUG was not in the compile line
UNIX>
</pre>

<h3>GDB The GNU Debugger</h3><br>
<p>
<b>gdb</b> requires that the executable, and 
all of the objects if separately compiled, be compiled with the -g switch.
For example
<pre>UNIX> gcc -g myfile.c
<pre>UNIX> gdb myfile
</pre>
It is then run by typing gdb &lt;filename&gt;.  This starts the debugger and
loads the executable.  It will inform you if there is no debugging
information available or no source code.  I will also inform you if the
source is newer that the executable.  In that case you may want to
recompile as the information may not correctly correspond.  When in the
debugger you can type help at the prompt and get some help information,
often about as much as the man pages.  
</p>
<p>The first thing you will want to do is set breakpoints, places in the
code where you want execution to stop so that you can examine data.  I
often start by typing <i>break</i> ( or just b) main.  Following <i>break</i> 
with a
function name causes the program to stop as soon as the function is
entered and you will have the parameters( if any ) displayed along
with the line number of the source file.  If you know a line number you
can enter it as "break myfile.c:234".  Once stopped at a break point,
you may use 
<ul>
<li> <i>next</i> (or n) to execute the next statement
<li> <i>step</i> (or s) "steps into" a function otherwise the function is 
executed as a statement
<li> <i>until</i> (u) causes loops to be executed "until done" after
they have been executed once 
<li> <i>continue</i> (c) causes the program execution to continue to the next 
breakpoint or until done.  

</ul>
One of the best things to use when you encounter segmentation faults, 
bus errors and the like is <i>bt</i>.  This is "back trace" and lets you 
see the execution stack.
</p>
<p>If you missed something and wish to start over type <i>run</i> (r) and you will
be able to start over from the beginning.  You will also need to use <i>run</i>
to begin the program and this is how you specify command line parameters
to the executable
<pre>
run -P myfile.jgr > output.ps
</pre> 
will cause the arguments -P and myfile.jgr to be passed to the
executable and its stdout to be redirected to output.ps.  
</p>
<p>It is often difficult to debug interactive processes because of the way
gdb handles input.  For instance if the next statement to be executed
is "scanf("%s",input);" and you use next, the program will wait for you
to type something in and press return but ONLY THE FIRST CHARACTER, will
be given to scanf and then gdb will say something like 
<pre>

> <i>Undefined command: "tart".  Try help</i>
</pre> 
if what you typed in was "start".  To get around this, place a
breakpoint <b>after</b> the statements which read keyboard input and "continue"
through them.  This will allow all the keyboard input to be read in and
then give you control back.
</p>
<p>If your process enters a continuous loop, you can type ^C and you will
get the debugger prompt back so that you can quit or start executing
statements one at a time.  The last thing to discuss here is the <i>print</i>
(p) command which allows you to examine program values.  The only time
this confusing is when pointers are involved.  But it maintains
consistency with C style type-casting.  
<pre>
print val 
will print out a character, a string (char *), an int, double, etc.
print str[9] 
will print out the 10th character in a string.
print (char *)(str+9)
will print out the string starting at the 10th character.
and so on.  Structures are printed with all fields and field-names.
</pre> 

<p>
<i>List</i> (l) lists (displays) the 10 lines surrounding the current line 
or the ten lines surrounding some (file:)line number.  Continued l's
successively list the file beginning at the last line displayed.  
</p>
<p>

Pressing return at anytime in gdb, with nothing at the prompt, repeats
the last command regardless whether it was valid or not.  So pressing <i>n</i>
for <i>next</i> then repeatedly pressing return cause the program to execute
one line at time.
</p>
<p>

A last thing about gdb is that you can attach to a currently running
process.  This is handy if you are forking off processes and want to
see what evil things they are doing before they die.  I find the only way
to really do this is put a <b>sleep(20)</b> or some such statement at the
beginning of the code I want to debug (which is of course running in
another window or in the background).  Then do ps to get the pid and
type "gdb <executable name> pid" and gdb will attach to the running
process.  VERY handy.  And when you quit gdb it does not terminate the 
process, just the debugger.
</p>
<pre>
Tests:

UNIX> simple0
simple0
Segmentation Fault
UNIX> gdb simple0
</pre><br>
Now you will be running the debugger.  When you get the prompt (gdb)
just type <i>run</i> and see what happens.  When executation stops type
<i>bt</i>.  This shows
<br>
<pre>
#0  0xef743de8 in strlen ()
#1  0xef7823ec in _doprnt ()
#2  0xef78b1c0 in printf ()
#3  0x10bc8 in pargs (num=1, array=0xeffff73c) at second.v0.c:63
#4  0x10840 in main (argc=1, argv=0xeffff73c) at first.v0.c:22
(gdb) 
</pre><br>
Which tells you that the execution was last in strlen().
Now type<br>
<pre>
(gdb) break pargs
(gdb) run
</pre><br>
and answer y to the question.  What will happen?  Program runs and stops
when it enters the function pargs. Then you can single step through it 
until the error occurs.

Try simple1 and step through it until the program terminates.  Why did
it just end without doing anything?  How do you singlestep?  Well
the best way is to first do<br>
<pre>
(gdb) break main
then do
(gdb) run
(gdb) next
</pre><br>
until you get to where you want to be.  Try examining some values with
print.  By the way it never does anything because the value of i is 0.
Now try
<pre>
UNIX> simple2 < test_input
</pre>
This will have an Arithmetic Exception error.  Try to find it.
Arithmetic exceptions are usually divide-by-zero errors.
Don't forget.  You can get help in the debugger by typing help at the 
prompt.
<p>
To see how to attach to a running process, do
<pre>
UNIX> my_last &
[1] 29025
UNIX> gdb my_last 29025

(Note that the pid that you get will be different and you need to use the
one returned on your machine.)

</pre>
<p>
<h3>PURIFY and QUANTIFY</h3>

<b>purify</b> and <b>quantify</b> are licensed products that will make finding memory
problems and speeding up your code much easier.  They are not in the 
normal paths but are located in /pkgs/rational/releases/PurifyPlus.2003a.06.12/sun4_solaris2/bin/purify and
/pkgs/rational/releases/PurifyPlus.2003a.06.12/sun4_solaris2/bin/quantify and the executables are <b>purify</b> and <b>quantify</b>.  Now
I do not know all there is to know about these programs but there are man
pages and I do have some test files that will give you the flavor of
them.
</p>
<p>

Basically <b>purify</b> and <b>quantify</b> instrument all the code/functions used in a
program.  Purify tracks memory usage/access and <b>quantify</b> tracks time
spent in functions and code.  They are easy to use, requiring only that
you recompile the executable and put <b>purify</b> or <b>quantify</b> before the
compile line.  You should use the -g option with <b>purify</b> for the line number 
information. For example:
<pre>

purify gcc -g myfile
quantify gcc myfile

</pre> 
Now this will be a relatively slow process and will result in some
additional overhead in the execution of the code but again you are
debugging/optimizing so execution time is a minor issue.  You should
also be aware that the most useful parts of these are going to be made
into pop-up windows so be prepared.  Ensure that if you are running the
processes on a remote machine that your display variable is set to the 
local display (for csh users at least)  by typing the following at
the prompt: "setenv DISPLAY '<'local display name'>':0.0".
</p>
<p>


Then just run the newly compiled executable and voila! instant
gratification.  More or less.  For repeated runs of the same executable
for <b>purify</b>, you do not need to exit the <b>purify</b> windows.  And in fact you
can also run gdb on a process you are <b>purify</b>ing so you can have better
access to the code/variables.  Read the man page
</p>

<pre>
Purify examples:

UNIX> pure0

This will bring up the <b>purify</b> window and then run the process.  You can 
examine the error by clicking on the box beside 

NPR: Null Pointer Read

then the box beside

pargs

Neat huh?


Now try 
UNIX> pure1

Purify will show 2 memory leaks.  I suspect this is because allocated memory 
was allocated but never used in the first case and incorrectly allocated in the
second.  This is a case where a little playing around with code will show what 
happens.

UNIX> pure2 < test_input

Here is where we find array bounds problems.

UNIX> pure3 < test_input

Another example of bad things happening only this time the program
did not die.

UNIX> gdb pure3

Now when you type <i>run</i> in gdb, as the program starts <b>purify</b> will come up
and you can run both together.  Check out the man page on <b>purify</b> for more
information on this.  Oh, don't forget that you can specify the command line
arguments in gdb by doing

(gdb) run < test_input

</pre>

<pre>
Quantify examples:


UNIX> usage0 < test_input
UNIX> usage1 < test_input
UNIX> usage2 < test_input
UNIX> usage3 < test_input
UNIX> usage4 < test_input

These examples are all the same source code.  I modified them by gradually
deleting calls to printf and some useless operations for randomization and
looping.  The source code is in the files

first.v3.c  & second.v3.c
first.v4.c  & second.v4.c
first.v5.c  & second.v5.c
first.v6.c  & second.v6.c
first.v6.c  & second.v7.c
