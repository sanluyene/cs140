Back to PGM files.  
<p>
To do this lab, you are 
to copy the program 
<b><a href=pgm_editor.cpp>pgm_editor.cpp</a></b>
from <b>/home/plank/cs140/Labs/Lab3</b>.  You'll note that there is a comment that
says "DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE".   I feel that this comment is pretty 
self-explanatory.  The gradescript will check to see if you have changed anything
below the line, and if you do, it will flag it as an error.  What you do is write
code where it says "Write your code here".  You compile this program and run it,
and that is what you submit for grading.
<p>
Here is <b><a href=pgm_editor.cpp>pgm_editor.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

typedef vector &lt;int&gt; IVec;

// Write your code here:

// DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE

void bad_pgm(string s)
{
  cerr &lt;&lt; "Bad PGM file: " &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
  exit(1);

}

....
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Your job is to write seven procedures.  You can figure out their parameter
types from how they are called within <b>pgm_editor.cpp</b>.  They all 
revolve around PGM files, which are held in a vector of vectors of ints.
Suppose that we have a PGM file <b>p</b>, declared as:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
vector &lt;IVec&gt; p;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Then <b>p.size()</b> is the number of rows of the PGM file.  Each element <b>p[i]</b>
will be a vector of the same size.  <b>p[i].size()</b> is the number of columns in the
PGM file.  And <b>p[i][j]</b> contains the pixel value in row <i>i</i> column <i>j</i>.
In the procedures that you write, you may assume that you get a valid PGM file as
input.  You do not have to error check.

<p>
The seven procedures are:
<OL>
<LI> <b>pgm_write(p)</b>: This writes a PGM file <b>p</b> to standard output.  I want the
output to be in a very specific format:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The first line is "P2"
<LI> The second line is the number of columns followed by a space and the number of rows.
There should be no special formatting to the second line.
<LI> The third line is the word "255".
<LI> The remaining lines have the pixels, 20 per line, each pixel printed with 
<b>printf("%4d")</b> and no extra spaces.  Obviously, the last line may be incomplete.
</UL>
<p>
<LI> <b>pgm_create(r, c, pv)</b>.  This creates and returns a PGM file which has <i>r</i>
rows, <i>c</i> columns, and all pixels have the value <i>pv</i>.
<p>
<LI> <b>pgm_cw(p)</b>.  This rotates <b>p</b> 90 degrees clockwise.  Obviously, <b>p</b>
must be a reference parameter.
<p>
<LI> <b>pgm_ccw(p)</b>.  This rotates <b>p</b> 90 degrees counterclockwise.  Obviously, <b>p</b>
must be a reference parameter.
<p>
<LI> <b>pgm_pad(p, w, pv)</b>.  This adds <i>w</i> pixels around the border of <b>p</b>.  All the pixels
will have the value <b>pv</b>.
<p>
<LI> <b>pgm_panel(p, r, c)</b>.  This changes <b>p</b> so that it has <b>r*c</b> copies of 
the PGM file, laid out in a <i>r * c</i> grid.  See the examples.
<p>
<LI> <b>pgm_crop(p, r, c, rows, cols)</b>.  This changes <b>p</b> so that it has a subset of
the original picture -- the rectangle starting at row <i>r</i> and column <i>c</i>, with 
<i>rows</i> rows and <i>cols</i> cols.
</OL>

When <b>pgm_editor</b> is compiled and running correctly, you can use it either to create
a PGM file, or to edit the PGM file on standard input and print the result on standard 
output.  For example:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>pgm_editor</b></font>
usage: pgm_editor command....

        CREATE rows cols pixvalue
        CW
        CCW
        PAD pixels pixvalue
        PANEL r c
        CROP r c rows cols
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<h3>BVZ Notes</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Dr. Plank's main is not declared to return an int, which could cause
  your program not to compile on a Mac. You can fix this problem by having
  your main return an int when compiling and testing it on a Mac. However,
  when you transfer the file to a hydra machine to test it, you will need
  to change main back to not returning an int. If you do not, then Dr. Plank's
  gradeall script will flag your program as incorrect, since you will have
  changed something below the "Do Not Change Anything" line.
<p>
<li> In pgm_write, you need to ensure that your pgm file ends with exactly
  one newline character. Hence if the number of pixels in your pgm file is
  not a multiple of 20, then you will need to output a newline character
  at the end of your pgm_write procedure. If the number of pixels in your
  pgm file is a multiple of 20, then your pgm_write procedure will already
  have written a newline character and you should not print a second one.
</ol>

<h3>Grading and Starting</h3>

Once again, you cannot modify the part of the program
that says "<b>DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE.</b>".  If so, the gradescript will
yell at you and won't get it correct.
<p>
To start this lab -- <i><b>and do this during lab</b></i>, write dummy versions of these
procedures that don't work, but that compile.  That way you at least have the procedure
declarations correct.  Then work on <b>pgm_create()</b> and <b>pgm_write()</b>.  
Then the others.  Think about when you should be using reference parameters.
