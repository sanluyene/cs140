I majored in Japanese because I was (and am) extremely interested in the language and culture. I originally wanted to become a diplomatic translator.
I graduated college in 2007, and never did anything specific to my degree. I had always been a computer junkie, and decided to teach myself everything I possibly could. This started with technical support, and eventually went beyond into the development world. Currently, I am employed as a Developer at a government contractor in Oak Ridge. I decided it was time to have some formal education in my career path, and started at the University of Tennessee!
